# GameShelf

GameShelf is a web application for managing a collection of games. It provides CRUD operations for games, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete game entries. The backend is built with FastAPI and uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions.

## Features
- Add new games to your shelf
- View all games
- Update game details
- Delete games
- RESTful API endpoints

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker (recommended)
- Python 3.8+ (for local development)

### Running the Application (Recommended)

The preferred way to run GameShelf is using Docker Compose. This will start both the API and a PostgreSQL database.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```zsh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd gameshelf
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```zsh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### Alternative: Local Development
If you prefer to run locally without Docker:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```zsh
   uv sync
   ```
2. Start a local PostgreSQL instance and set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
3. Run the app:
   ```zsh
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
